# PokeDex

Hello! I'm Manuel Vargas and I've created this project to show the benefits of react-native and redux 😉😉

## Stack
- React
- Redux
- React-native
- React-redux
- React-navigation
- Axios
- Redux-persist
- Lodash
- Lottie
- Prop-types

## Instalation

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/devmanny/pokedex`

`cd pokedex`

`yarn install`


Link some packages (optional):

`react-native link lottie-ios;`

`react-native link lottie-react-native;`

## Execution

> IMPORTANT 🚨: Lottie has not been updated at all and requires a special Xcode configuration

-  Xcode > File > Project settings 
- Set "Build System" as: "Legacy"
