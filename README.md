# PokeDex

Hello! I'm Manuel Vargas and I've created this project to show the benefits of react-native and redux ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

## Stack
- React
- Redux
- React-native
- React-redux
- React-navigation
- Axios
- Redux-persist
- Lodash
- Lottie
- Prop-types

## Instalation

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/devmanny/pokedex`
`cd pokedex`
`yarn install`

Link some packages (optional):
`react-native link lottie-ios;`
`react-native link lottie-react-native;`

## Execution

> IMPORTANT ðŸš¨: Lottie has not been updated at all and requires a special Xcode configuration
